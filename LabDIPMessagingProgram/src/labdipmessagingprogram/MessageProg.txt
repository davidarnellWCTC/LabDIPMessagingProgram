LabDIP Message Program

This program is a replacement for the DIP Lab.

Messages are created from concrete "message" classes rather than interfaces.
This example was created -clumsily- without a reference from the example provided
on blackboard. 

The intention of this program is as a proof of concept to create a message prog
that can create, transmit, and display messages of different data types.

The messages will all be created and drawn from the same class but made from
different methods in the message service interface classes.
