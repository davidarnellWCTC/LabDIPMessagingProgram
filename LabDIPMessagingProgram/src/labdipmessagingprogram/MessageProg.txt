LabDIP Message Program

This program is a replacement for the DIP Lab.

Messages are created from concrete "message" classes rather than interfaces.
This example was created -clumsily- without a reference from the example provided
on blackboard. 

The intention of this program is as a proof of concept to create a message prog
that can create, transmit, and display messages of different data types.

The messages will all be created and drawn from the same class but made from
different methods in the message service interface classes. This means that no
matter what class or method or whatever thing that creates a message does so by
creating a new "message" object. A new "hello world" message is still a "message"
object. The same "getStringMessage" method used to get the "hello world" message
is the same method used to get a custom message object. I believe this makes not
just the methods and classes portable but the whole program portable. 

ENCAPSULATE WHAT VARIES
What varies is what the message type is and what the message contents are. By
making each message be a "message" object, no matter what the type or contents
are, the message is fully encapsulated by being a "message" object.
